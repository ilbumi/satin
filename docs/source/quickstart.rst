Quick Start Guide
=================

This guide will help you get started with SATIn for image annotation tasks.

Creating Your First Project
---------------------------

1. **Start the Application**

   Follow the :doc:`installation` guide to set up and start SATIn.

2. **Create a New Project**

   Navigate to the projects page and click "New Project":

   - Enter a project name (e.g., "My Dataset")
   - Add a description
   - Set project settings

3. **Upload Images**

   In your project:

   - Click "Add Images"
   - Select multiple image files
   - Wait for upload completion

Annotating Images
----------------

1. **Open Annotation Interface**

   Click "Annotate" on any image to open the annotation workspace.

2. **Select Annotation Tool**

   - Choose "Bounding Box" tool from the toolbar
   - Click and drag to create bounding boxes around objects

3. **Add Labels**

   - Type labels for each bounding box
   - Use the annotation panel to manage annotations

4. **Save Progress**

   Your annotations are automatically saved as you work.

Managing Tasks
--------------

**Creating Tasks**

Tasks help organize annotation work:

- Assign specific images to annotators
- Set deadlines and priorities
- Track completion status

**Task Workflow**

1. Create task with assigned images
2. Assign to team members
3. Monitor progress
4. Review completed annotations

Best Practices
--------------

**Consistent Labeling**

- Use consistent label names across your dataset
- Create a labeling guide for your team
- Review annotations for quality

**Efficient Workflow**

- Process similar images together
- Use keyboard shortcuts for faster annotation
- Save frequently to avoid data loss

**Quality Control**

- Review completed annotations
- Use multiple annotators for important datasets
- Export data regularly for backup
